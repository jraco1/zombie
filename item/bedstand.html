            <p>The latest in bedside protection is the self defense bedstand.
            During sleeping, eating, cooking, and other unnecessary downtime enjoy the look of this stylish nightstand.
            Keep your bedroom clutter-free and organized.
            However, once the undead horde show up again, simply pull it apart to reveal BOTH a comfy shield and handy bat!
            (Nails, barbed wire, and attack bunnies sold separately)
            Once the fun is over, simply rinse off in bleach, run through a dishwasher, reassemble, and try to sleeping
            despite the overwhelming hopelessness that engulfs you in the darkness!</p>

                        item is only rated to 3.2, they overwhelm me and I have to yell for help because they are going to
                        be mean to me!

                        This nightstand fends off the zombs as advertised, and it shipped in under a year 
                        (that's why it's not one star), but functionally it has a major flaw: my doilies fall off the moment 
                        I take it apart to defend myself!  I had to attach them with superglue to keep them in place.  Buyer beware!
