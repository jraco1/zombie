            <p>You survive a bear attack by running faster than the other guy.  Now to survive a zombie attack all you have
            to do is SMELL worse than the other guy!  Stinky enough to repell even the undead, as a bonus it also protects your
            shoes from theft (at no extra charge!).  Just spray and pray that your "best buddy" didn't buy some themselves!</p>

                            I came here for the infinity stones.  Little did I know there was an undead uprising in progress.
                            Great timing.  Earth's defenders have been kept busy, and once I applied this product the zombies
                            stayed far away from me.  Getting the last few stones for my gauntlet was a SNAP!
